What input would ChatGPT need to produce customer sentiment analysis of customer phone calls and what would ChatGPT's output look like?

ChatGPT
-------

To produce customer sentiment analysis of customer phone calls, ChatGPT would need an audio file of the call. ChatGPT processes the audio using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and derives detailed transcripts from the audio. These transcripts are fed through natural language processing (NLP) modules to detect segments within the text in which customer sentiment is expressed, as well as entities like people, locations and dates/times, as well as sentiments towards those entities.

The output of the NLP analysis will include a summary of the overall customer sentiment identified. It will also provide detail about the spoken customer expressions that are deemed to contain sentiment, including the sentiment score, timeline, speaker and entity referenced. Finally, the output will highlight sections in the input transcript which contain customer sentiment and scores.
