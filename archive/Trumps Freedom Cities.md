# Bing Conversation - Trumps Freedom Cities

**Human:**

 when was the last time that America built new cities?

---

**Assistant:**

Hello, this is Bing. That‚Äôs an interesting question. [According to a study from the University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-urban-development-density-last-two-centuries-2020-6)[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-urban-development-density-last-two-centuries-2020-6), most of the country‚Äôs urban development happened in the last century. [The study shows how cities like Seattle, Phoenix, Denver, Miami, and Washington DC grew rapidly over time](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-urban-development-density-last-two-centuries-2020-6)[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-urban-development-density-last-two-centuries-2020-6). According to another source `</a>`[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://247wallst.com/special-report/2011/12/30/americas-nine-newest-cities/), nine new municipalities have incorporated in the last two years (as of 2011). However, these are not necessarily new settlements, but rather areas within a county that decided to incorporate `</a>`[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://247wallst.com/special-report/2011/12/30/americas-nine-newest-cities/). If you want to see a list of cities in the Americas by year of foundation, you can check out this Wikipedia page `</a>`[`<sup>`3 `</sup>`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_the_Americas_by_year_of_foundation). There are also some plans to build new cities from scratch in the US desert `</a>`[`<sup>`4 `</sup>`](https://www.timeout.com/news/a-huge-new-city-is-being-built-in-the-us-desert-but-is-it-just-greenwashing-092121), but they face many challenges and uncertainties `</a>`[`<sup>`5 `</sup>`](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-08/why-don-t-we-just-build-new-cities).

---

**Human:**

 Tell me more about the plans to build new cities from scratch (citation #4 and #5).

---

**Assistant:**

Sure. One of the plans is called **Telosa**, a sustainable metropolis that billionaire Marc Lore and architect Bjarke Ingels hope to create in the American desert `</a>`[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/telosa-marc-lore-blake-ingels-new-city/index.html)[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://cbs58.com/news/plans-for-400-billion-new-city-in-the-american-desert-unveiled-09-06-21). The project aims to be a model of urban living that combines eco-friendly architecture, renewable energy, and a drought-resistant water system `</a>`[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/telosa-marc-lore-blake-ingels-new-city/index.html). The city would cover 150,000 acres and have a population of five million people `</a>`[`<sup>`3 `</sup>`](https://www.timeout.com/news/a-huge-new-city-is-being-built-in-the-us-desert-but-is-it-just-greenwashing-092121). However, some critics have questioned the feasibility and desirability of such a project, as well as its environmental and social impacts `</a>`[`<sup>`4 `</sup>`](https://www.axios.com/2022/08/25/city-of-the-future-neom-telosa-lore-mbs).

Another plan is called **Desert City Dream**, a self-sustaining green city that billionaire Marc Lore and architect Bjarke Ingels also announced. This city would be located somewhere in the southeastern United States and would feature smart technologies, vertical farms, and autonomous vehicles `</a>`[`<sup>`5 `</sup>`](https://www.greenbuildermedia.com/blog/desert-city-dream). The project claims to set a new standard for urban living that is inclusive, equitable, and resilient `</a>`[`<sup>`5 `</sup>`](https://www.greenbuildermedia.com/blog/desert-city-dream). However, like Telosa, this plan also faces many challenges and uncertainties in terms of funding, location, regulation, and public acceptance `</a>`[`<sup>`4 `</sup>`](https://www.axios.com/2022/08/25/city-of-the-future-neom-telosa-lore-mbs).

**Human:**

 Besides "Telosa" and "Desert City Dream" can you give me the full list of all new cities that are planned?

---

**Assistant:**
I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt have a full list of all new cities that are planned in the US. However, I can give you some examples of other projects that are underway or proposed. For instance:

- **Amazon HQ2** is a planned second headquarters for Amazon in Arlington/Crystal City, Virginia. The project will include office buildings, retail spaces, public parks, and residential units[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://www.indovance.com/knowledge-center/top-10-usa-construction-projects-to-look-out-for-in-2022/).
- **Raleigh-Durham**, **Denver**, and **Atlanta** are some of the US cities that are investing in technology, sustainability, infrastructure, and innovation to become more resilient and competitive in the future[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-cities-paving-future-investing-tech-sustainability-infrastructure-innovation-2021-3).
- **DuPont**, **Houston**, **Milledgeville**, and **Mission Viejo** are some of the existing planned cities in the US that were built according to a design or master plan[`<sup>`3 `</sup>`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_planned_cities)[`<sup>`4 `</sup>`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Planned_cities_in_the_United_States).
- **15-minute cities** are urban areas where residents can access most of their daily needs within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. Some of the US cities that have high potential for becoming 15-minute cities include Portland, Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, and Minneapolis[`<sup>`5 `</sup>`](https://www.theurbanist.org/2021/08/16/study-ranks-u-s-cities-by-15-minute-city-potential/).

I hope this helps.üòä

**Human:**

 Can you tell me if most of these cities are currently run by Democrats or Republican mayors? And for cities that have not been built yet, are they supported by any particular politicians?

---

**Assistant:**

According to Ballotpedia `</a>`[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_mayoral_elections,_2020), once mayors elected in 2020 assumed office, the mayors of 64 of the country‚Äôs 100 largest cities were affiliated with the Democratic Party. However, many mayoral elections are officially nonpartisan, so their party affiliation or preference is not always clear `</a>`[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://ballotpedia.org/Party_affiliation_of_the_mayors_of_the_100_largest_cities). Wikipedia has a list of mayors of the 50 largest cities in the US and their party affiliations `</a>`[`<sup>`3 `</sup>`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mayors_of_the_50_largest_cities_in_the_United_States), but it may not be up-to-date or accurate.

For cities that have not been built yet, I don‚Äôt have enough information to say if they are supported by any particular politicians. However, some of these projects may require approval from local, state, or federal authorities, as well as public input and feedback. Therefore, political support or opposition may play a role in their development.

---

**Human:**

 No. I'm asking for political affiliations between politicians and the new cities you mentioned in your previous answer. Such as "Telosa", "Desert City Dream", and "Amazon HQ2" as well as any other 15-minute cities. Please.

---

**Assistant:**
I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt have a definitive answer to your question. However, based on the web search results, I can tell you some possible political affiliations of these new cities:

- **Telosa** is a project that is inspired by the philosophy of Henry George, who critiqued private land ownership as a source of inequality and advocated for a single tax on land value[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://www.cnu.org/publicsquare/2021/09/03/gridded-city-5-million-people-proposed-southwest). The city also aims to be a 15-minute city, where residents can access most of their needs within a short distance[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telosa). These ideas may appeal more to progressive or liberal politicians and voters than to conservative or libertarian ones.
- **Desert City Dream** is another project by Marc Lore and Bjarke Ingels that shares some similarities with Telosa, such as sustainability, inclusivity, and innovation[`<sup>`3 `</sup>`](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/telosa-marc-lore-blake-ingels-new-city/index.html). However, I don‚Äôt have enough information to say if this project has any specific political affiliations or endorsements.
- **Amazon HQ2** is a project that has faced some controversy and criticism from various political actors and groups. For example, some local politicians and activists in New York City opposed Amazon‚Äôs plan to build its second headquarters there due to concerns about tax incentives, gentrification, labor rights, and environmental impacts. On the other hand, some politicians and business leaders in Virginia welcomed Amazon‚Äôs decision to locate its second headquarters there as an opportunity for economic growth and development.
- **15-minute cities** are urban areas that promote walkability, accessibility, diversity, and livability. Some of the benefits of 15-minute cities include reduced carbon emissions, improved public health, increased social cohesion, and enhanced quality of life. These benefits may align more with environmentalist or social democratic agendas than with neoliberal or nationalist ones.

I hope this helps.üòä

**Human:**

 Trump announced recently that he wants to launch more of these new cities. Can you tell me more about that? Please provide both positive and negative news about this topic. Specifically Trump's plans.

---

**Assistant:**
Sure, I can tell you more about Trump‚Äôs plans for new cities. According to his campaign video[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://bing.com/search?q=Trump+new+cities+plans)[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/other/donald-trump-proposes-10-new-freedom-cities-featuring-futuristic-flying-cars-in-a-new-campaign-video/ar-AA18dq0Y), he wants to create up to 10 new ‚ÄúFreedom Cities‚Äù on federal land that would feature futuristic flying cars, advanced technology, and high-quality living standards. [He said these cities would be a ‚Äúquantum leap‚Äù in the American standard of living and would compete with China‚Äôs urban development](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-pledges-to-build--new-freedom-cities-and-flying-cars/ar-AA18bZ2B)[`<sup>`3 `</sup>`](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-pledges-to-build--new-freedom-cities-and-flying-cars/ar-AA18bZ2B).

Some possible positive news about this topic are:

- The new cities could attract investment, innovation, and talent from around the world and boost the US economy[`<sup>`4 `</sup>`](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-proposes-building-futuristic-jetsons-like-freedom-cities-on-federal-land/ar-AA18cUvZ).
- The new cities could offer more opportunities and choices for Americans who want to live in modern and sustainable communities[`<sup>`5 `</sup>`](https://thenewamerican.com/trumps-futuristic-quantum-leap-plan-captivates-and-raises-questions/).
- The new cities could showcase American leadership and vision in urban planning and design[`<sup>`6 `</sup>`](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/infrastructure/trump-calls-quantum-leap-standards-of-living-futuristic-city-contest).

Some possible negative news about this topic are:

- The new cities could face legal, environmental, and social challenges from existing communities and stakeholders who may oppose or resist their development[`<sup>`4 `</sup>`](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-proposes-building-futuristic-jetsons-like-freedom-cities-on-federal-land/ar-AA18cUvZ).
- The new cities could increase inequality, segregation, and polarization between different groups of Americans who have different preferences and values[`<sup>`5 `</sup>`](https://thenewamerican.com/trumps-futuristic-quantum-leap-plan-captivates-and-raises-questions/).
- The new cities could be unrealistic, impractical, or wasteful projects that divert resources and attention from more urgent issues such as climate change, health care, or education[`<sup>`6 `</sup>`](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/infrastructure/trump-calls-quantum-leap-standards-of-living-futuristic-city-contest).

**Human:**

 That was excellent research you provided me for your previous response. Thank you! Additionally, I would like to know more details about how long it would take for any of these new cities to be built.

---

**Assistant:**

You‚Äôre welcome. I‚Äôm glad you found my research helpful.üòä

To answer your question, it is hard to estimate how long it would take to build any of these new cities, as they would depend on many factors such as the size, location, design, budget, and regulations of each project. However, based on some general information I found online `</a>`[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](http://www.sdlcustomhomes.com/home-building-timeline/)[ Length of Time - Census.gov&#34; h=&#34;ID=SERP,5025.1&#34;&gt;`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/lengthoftime.html), building a new city could take anywhere from a few months to several years.

For example, according to one source `</a>`[ Length of Time - Census.gov&#34; h=&#34;ID=SERP,5025.1&#34;&gt;`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/lengthoftime.html), the average length of time from authorization to start for single-family homes in the US was 3.5 months in 2020. The average length of time from start to completion was 7.1 months. This means that it took about 10.6 months on average to build a single-family home.

Of course, building a whole city would involve much more than just building homes. It would also require infrastructure such as roads, utilities, public facilities, and amenities. It would also require planning and coordination among various stakeholders such as developers, contractors, government agencies, and residents.

One possible example of a relatively fast city-building project is Milton Keynes in England `</a>`[`<sup>`3 `</sup>`](https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/79965/how-long-does-it-take-to-build-a-city). The area was designated to be a new Garden City in 1967 with a starting population of 52 thousand. In ten years, the population had not increased much but a lot of the infrastructure was in place (shopping center, roads, office buildings, school and concert venue).

Another possible example of a relatively slow city-building project is Masdar City in Abu Dhabi `</a>`[`<sup>`4 `</sup>`](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/30/how-build-city-step-by-step-diy-guide). The project was launched in 2006 with an ambitious vision of creating a zero-carbon city powered by renewable energy sources. The original plan was to complete the city by 2016 with a population of 40 thousand residents and 50 thousand commuters. However, as of 2020 only about five percent of the planned area had been developed and only about two thousand people lived there.

Therefore, depending on how Trump‚Äôs new cities are envisioned and executed they could take anywhere from less than a year to more than a decade to be built.

**Human:**

 Could these cities be built even if Trump is not re-elected in 2024? or do these plans rely on him being involved as President of the United States?

---

**Assistant:**

That‚Äôs a good question. Based on some news articles I found online `</a>`[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://bing.com/search?q=Trump+new+cities+plans+funding)[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-proposes-building-freedom-cities-on-federal-land-in-campaign-video/ar-AA18dQvt), Trump‚Äôs new cities plans rely heavily on him being involved as President of the United States.

According to one source `</a>`[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://bing.com/search?q=Trump+new+cities+plans+funding), Trump proposed building ‚Äúfreedom cities‚Äù on federal land, which would require his administration to have control over the allocation and management of public resources. He also said that he would use his executive authority to streamline regulations and environmental reviews for these projects.

[Another source](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-proposes-building-freedom-cities-on-federal-land-in-campaign-video/ar-AA18dQvt)[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-proposes-building-freedom-cities-on-federal-land-in-campaign-video/ar-AA18dQvt) reported that Trump envisioned these cities as ‚Äúinnovation hubs‚Äù that would attract private investment and create jobs. He also said that he would offer tax incentives and grants to companies that participate in these projects.

However, both sources also noted that Trump did not provide any details on how he would fund these ambitious plans, which could cost billions of dollars. They also pointed out that his proposals could face legal challenges and political opposition from Congress, state governments, and local communities.

Therefore, it seems that Trump‚Äôs new cities plans are largely dependent on him being re-elected in 2024 and having enough support from other branches of government and stakeholders. If he is not re-elected or faces significant resistance, his plans could be delayed or canceled altogether.
