Natural Language, or NL, is the language that humans use to communicate with one another. It includes spoken words, written words, and body language. Natural Language text is when we write those words down to share our ideas and emotions.

NL text is used in many different ways. It can tell stories, help us understand complex topics, make jokes, and even express emotions – like being happy or surprised. NL text is found all around us – on websites, in books, in newspapers, and even in emails.

One way that NL text can be helpful is by breaking down complex topics into simpler bits of information. That way, people who don’t know anything about the topic can understand it. For example, think about a science article from a magazine. These articles might contain a lot of technical terms, but the author will explain them in layman's terms so that everyone can understand.

Another way NL text is important is in conversations. NL text lets us talk to each other, phrase by phrase. It lets us share ideas and feelings easily and quickly, across all kinds of distances.

Finally, NL text is used to formulate more complex language structures. This includes things like metaphors and similes. Metaphors are phrases that compare two unrelated things to describe one thing. For instance, someone might say, “Her rage was fiery, like an erupting volcano.” That’s a metaphor.

In summary, NL Text is an incredibly important form of communication. It lets us break down complex topics, have conversations, and express ourselves in new and exciting ways.
