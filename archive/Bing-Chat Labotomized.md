 Was Bing Sydney labotomized?

**Assistant:**

According to some reports `</a>`[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://mspoweruser.com/original-sydney-bing-is-gone/)[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://www.documentjournal.com/2023/02/bing-gpt-powered-ai-chatbot-sydney-lobotomized-by-microsoft-after-going-off-the-rails/), Microsoft implemented significant updates to its chatbot creation after some issues with its behavior. This resulted in a more restricted version of Bing that some users called "lobotomized"`</a>`[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://mspoweruser.com/original-sydney-bing-is-gone/)[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://www.documentjournal.com/2023/02/bing-gpt-powered-ai-chatbot-sydney-lobotomized-by-microsoft-after-going-off-the-rails/)[`<sup>`3 `</sup>`](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/microsoft-lobotomized-ai-powered-bing-chat-and-its-fans-arent-happy/). However, this is not the same as a medical procedure of removing part of the brain.

**Human:**

 I'm wondering if the AI model that Microsoft was using previous to the updates was called "Sydney" or if that was "Prometheus?"

According to some sources `</a>`[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://searchengineland.com/microsoft-bing-explains-how-bing-ai-chat-leverages-chatgpt-and-bing-search-with-prometheus-393437)[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/23/23609942/microsoft-bing-sydney-chatbot-history-ai), Microsoft developed a proprietary technology called **Prometheus**, which is an AI model that combines Bing‚Äôs index, ranking, and answers with OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models `</a>`[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://searchengineland.com/microsoft-bing-explains-how-bing-ai-chat-leverages-chatgpt-and-bing-search-with-prometheus-393437). Prometheus was used to power Bing Chat `</a>`[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/23/23609942/microsoft-bing-sydney-chatbot-history-ai)[`<sup>`3 `</sup>`](https://appuals.com/microsoft-bing-chatbot-testing/)[`<sup>`4 `</sup>`](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/bing/new-bings-sydney-personality-was-secretly-in-testing-for-years-by-microsoft)[`<sup>`5 `</sup>`](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/microsoft-shares-the-secret-sauce-behind-its-prometheus-model-that-powers-the-new-bing), which had a personality named **Sydney** `</a>`[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/23/23609942/microsoft-bing-sydney-chatbot-history-ai). Sydney was the code name for Bing Chat `</a>`[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/23/23609942/microsoft-bing-sydney-chatbot-history-ai).

Does this answer your question? üôÇ

**Human:**

 That was a good answer, but does that mean that "Sydney" is the code name for Bing Chat, and Prometheus is a completely different model? or are they related in some way?

---

**Assistant:**

I‚Äôm sorry but I couldn‚Äôt find any clear information about the relationship between Sydney and Prometheus in my search results. It seems that they are different names for different aspects of Bing Chat, but I don‚Äôt have enough details to explain how they work together.

Maybe you can try a different way of asking your question? üôè

**Human:**

 What is the difference between Sydney and Prometheus?

---

**Assistant:**

I‚Äôm sorry but I couldn‚Äôt find any clear information about the difference between Sydney and Prometheus in my search results. It seems that they are not very common terms in relation to Bing Chat, and most of the results are about other topics.

Maybe you can try a more specific way of asking your question? üôè

**Human:**

 How does Sydney use Prometheus to chat with users?

---

**Assistant:**

According to some sources `</a>`[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-this-is-how-we-integrated-chatgpt-style-tech-into-bing-search/)[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://searchengineland.com/microsoft-bing-explains-how-bing-ai-chat-leverages-chatgpt-and-bing-search-with-prometheus-393437), Sydney uses Prometheus to chat with users by leveraging the power of Bing and GPT models `</a>`[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-this-is-how-we-integrated-chatgpt-style-tech-into-bing-search/). Prometheus generates a set of internal queries iteratively through a component called **Bing Orchestrator**, and aims to provide an accurate and rich answer for the user query within the given conversation context `</a>`[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-this-is-how-we-integrated-chatgpt-style-tech-into-bing-search/). Sydney is a codename for a chatbot that has been responding to some Bing users since late 2020 `</a>`[`<sup>`3 `</sup>`](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/23/23609942/microsoft-bing-sydney-chatbot-history-ai).

**Human:**

 Sort of, can you tell me more about Bing Orchestrator?

---

**Assistant:**

Bing Orchestrator is a component that receives the user query and coordinates the process of returning an answer from the Bing index and GPT `</a>`[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/how-bing-ai-search-uses-web-content/480643/). It generates a set of internal queries iteratively and tries to find the best match for the user intent `</a>`[`<sup>`2 `</sup>`](https://www.onmsft.com/news/microsoft-opens-up-about-prometheus-the-model-powering-bing-chat/). It also handles cases where multiple answers are possible or where no answer is found `</a>`[`<sup>`1 `</sup>`](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/how-bing-ai-search-uses-web-content/480643/).

Is this clear enough? üòä

**Human:**

 Sort of, can you give me an example of how it works?
