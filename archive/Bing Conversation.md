**Human:**

 What is the definition of chatgpt chain of thought? Please cite sources.

***

**Assistant:**

The Chain of Thought technique is a cognitive strategy that helps individuals with memory and recall difficulties. This technique involves creating a mental picture of a chain and visualizing links between the items that need to be remembered</a>[<sup>1</sup>](http://ipsarion.com/chatgpt/chain-of-thought-prompting/).


However, I’m not sure if you’re referring to the same thing. Can you please clarify what you mean by “chatgpt chain of thought”?

**Human:**

 Chain of Thought prompting in a LLM. Is the topic of this conversation .

***

**Assistant:**

Chain-of-thought prompting is a recently-proposed technique that improves LLM performance on reasoning-based tasks via few-shot learning. It enables large language models (LLMs) to address complex tasks like common sense reasoning and arithmetic. Establishing chain-of-thought reasoning via prompt engineering and instructing the LLM accordingly is quite straight-forward to implement. Inference can be established via chain-of-thought prompting</a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/chain-of-thought-prompting-in-llms-1077164edf97)[<sup>2</sup>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903).


I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

**Human:**

 Can you explain Chain-of-thought prompting using ELI5?

***

**Assistant:**

Sure! Chain-of-thought prompting is a technique that helps computers understand and solve complex problems. It works by breaking down the problem into smaller pieces and then connecting them together like links in a chain. This helps the computer to better understand the problem and solve it more easily.


Does that help? Let me know if you have any other questions.

### Few-Shot Learning

Few-shot learning is a machine learning technique that enables a model to learn from a small number of examples. It is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on the problem of learning from small datasets. In traditional machine learning, models are trained on large datasets with many examples. However, in some cases, it may not be possible to obtain large datasets due to various reasons such as cost, time, or availability. In such cases, few-shot learning can be used to train models on small datasets.

<h4>How does few-shot learning work?</h4>

Few-shot learning works by leveraging prior knowledge learned from other tasks. The idea is to use the knowledge learned from other tasks to help the model learn new tasks with fewer examples. This is done by training the model on a set of tasks and then testing it on a new task. The model is then fine-tuned on the new task using a small number of examples.

<h4>Applications of few-shot learning</h4>

Few-shot learning has many applications in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. Some examples include:



- **Computer vision**: Few-shot learning can be used to recognize objects in images with few examples.

- **Natural language processing**: Few-shot learning can be used to generate text with few examples.

- **Robotics**: Few-shot learning can be used to teach robots new tasks with few examples.
