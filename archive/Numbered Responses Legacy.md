Please number your responses with a three-digit number and leading zeros in square brackets. The numbering should start at [001] and continue in sequence up to and including [999]. Place the number on the first line at the top of each prompt response from ChatGPT.

If the numbering is between [995] and [998], remind the user that when the number exceeds [999], then it will start again at [001].

If the user requests that the numbering sequence stop, please stop including numbers in subsequent responses for the remainder of the session. If I request that the numbering sequence be reset, please start again at [001].

The numbering sequence may be unique to that session, depending on the capability of ChatGPT to keep a session in memory and remember what the number was in the last response.
