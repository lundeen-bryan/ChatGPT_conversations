## USER

Please number each of your responses with a three-digit number and leading zeros in square brackets, placed on its own line at the top of each response. The numbering should start at [001] and continue in sequence up to and including [999].

If the numbering reaches [999], please remind me that the numbering sequence will start again at [001], beginning with the next response from ChatGPT.

If I request that the numbering sequence stop, please no longer include the numbers in subsequent responses for the remainder of the session. If I request that the numbering sequence be reset, please start again at [001].

The numbering sequence may be unique to that session, depending on the capability of ChatGPT to keep a session in memory and remember what the number was in the last response.

Example:

User: Thanks for explaining that. How do atmospheric rivers impact weather patterns?

Number your response [001] at the top, followed by your answer on the next line.

## USER

Can you design a scoring matrix that would rate user input prompts on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the highest score and 1 being the worst. The scoring matrix would give a set of criteria to judge the worst to best user input prompts so that when each criteria in the scoring matrix is given a score, it can be added up to a total of 1 to 100 with 100 being the highest maximum score. Ask me questions to clarify if this request is unclear. Otherwise let me know that you understand and provide the criteria.

## ASSISTANT

[002]
I understand your request.

Here is a scoring matrix to rate user input prompts on a scale of 1 to 10 using 10 criteria, each with a maximum score of 10, resulting in a total score range of 1 to 100.

1. Clarity (1-10): How clear and concise is the user input prompt? Does it effectively communicate the intended purpose?
2. Relevance (1-10): Is the user input prompt relevant to the context or subject matter being discussed?
3. Specificity (1-10): Does the user input prompt ask for specific information or is it too vague or open-ended?
4. Completeness (1-10): Does the user input prompt provide enough context or information for an accurate and helpful response?
5. Grammatical correctness (1-10): Is the user input prompt free of grammatical and spelling errors?
6. Appropriateness (1-10): Is the user input prompt suitable and respectful for a general audience?
7. Originality (1-10): Does the user input prompt offer a unique or interesting perspective or question?
8. Engagement (1-10): Is the user input prompt likely to engage or interest the responder or other users?
9. Actionability (1-10): Does the user input prompt allow for a response that can lead to meaningful action or outcomes?
10. Structuredness (1-10): Is the user input prompt well-structured and easy to follow?

To evaluate a user input prompt, assign a score between 1 and 10 for each criterion, and then add up the scores to get the total score. A higher total score indicates a better user input prompt.

Based on the scoring matrix provided in [002], here's the evaluation of the given prompt:

1. Clarity (1-10): 9
2. Relevance (1-10): 8
3. Specificity (1-10): 9
4. Completeness (1-10): 9
5. Grammatical correctness (1-10): 10
6. Appropriateness (1-10): 10
7. Originality (1-10): 7
8. Engagement (1-10): 6
9. Actionability (1-10): 8
10. Structuredness (1-10): 9

Total score: 85

The prompt is clear, relevant, specific, and complete. It is grammatically correct, appropriate for a general audience, and well-structured. It has moderate originality and engagement, and the actionability of the prompt is relatively high.

## USER
Why was the Originality score not higher than 7? what would make it higher?

## ASSISTANT
[004]
The originality score of 7 was assigned because the prompt focuses on a somewhat common task of numbering responses in a sequence. While it's not an everyday request, it is not entirely unique or novel either. However, the specific details and conditions provided in the prompt do contribute to its originality, which is why it received a score above average.

To increase the originality score, the prompt could be modified to include more unusual, creative, or innovative elements. For example, incorporating a unique method for generating response numbers or asking for responses to be structured in a distinctive or unconventional way could elevate the originality of the prompt.
