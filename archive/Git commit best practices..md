[I want to learn how to create better Git commit messages. I think my Git commit messages don't explain what changes took place.  Lets start with an essay with the following ordered headings: A. Numbered List of Examples of Poorly Written Commit Messages; B. Numbered List of Well Written Commit Messages; C. Preconditions That Should Exist Before You Write Your Commit Message; D. Numbered List of Rules To Follow When Composing a Good Commit Message; E. Frequently Asked Questions About Git Commit Messages; F. Numbered List of Books and Articles For Understanding Git Commit Best Practices] If you understand these requirements, begin your response; else ask me questions that would better clarify the requirements. Do you understand?

## ASSISTANT
Yes, I understand the requirements. Let's begin with the essay on creating better Git commit messages.

A. Numbered List of Examples of Poorly Written Commit Messages:
1. "Fixed some bugs"
2. "Updated code"
3. "Changes made"

B. Numbered List of Well Written Commit Messages:
1. "Fix typo in login screen"
2. "Add new feature for user profile customization"
3. "Refactor code to improve performance"

C. Preconditions That Should Exist Before You Write Your Commit Message:
1. You should have a clear understanding of what changes you have made in your code.
2. You should have tested your changes thoroughly and ensured that they do not break any existing functionality.
3. You should have reviewed your code and made sure that it follows the established coding standards of the project.

D. Numbered List of Rules To Follow When Composing a Good Commit Message:
1. Use imperative mood: Start the message with a verb in the imperative mood, such as "Add", "Fix", "Update", etc.
2. Keep it concise: Keep the message short and to the point, ideally less than 50 characters.
3. Explain the changes: Provide a brief description of what changes were made in the commit.
4. Provide additional details if needed: If the changes are more complex, provide additional details in the commit message.
5. Use proper formatting: Use proper formatting such as bullet points, paragraphs, or code blocks to make the message more readable.
6. Avoid using slang, abbreviations, or acronyms: Use clear and concise language that everyone on the team can understand.

E. Frequently Asked Questions About Git Commit Messages:
1. What is the purpose of a Git commit message?
- The purpose of a Git commit message is to provide a brief and clear description of the changes made in the commit.

2. How do I edit a commit message?
- Use the "git commit --amend" command to edit the most recent commit message.

3. Can I change the commit message of an older commit?
- Yes, you can use the "git rebase -i" command to interactively rebase commits and change their messages.

F. Numbered List of Books and Articles For Understanding Git Commit Best Practices:
1. "Pro Git" by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub
2. "Git Best Practices" by Lucas Dohmen
3. "How to Write a Git Commit Message" by Chris Beams (https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

Is there any way to send longer commit messages in VS Code?

## ASSISTANT
Yes, there is a way to send longer commit messages in VS Code. By default, VS Code's integrated Git client uses a single-line input field for commit messages. However, you can configure VS Code to use a separate editor window for entering commit messages, which allows for longer, multi-line messages.

To do this, open your VS Code user settings by clicking on "File" > "Preferences" > "Settings". In the search bar, type "git.inputEditor", and then click on the "Edit in settings.json" link that appears below.

In the settings.json file, add the following line:

```json
"git.inputEditor": "code --wait"
```

This will configure Git to open a separate editor window using VS Code whenever you enter a commit message. In this window, you can write a longer, multi-line message and save it using the usual VS Code shortcuts (e.g., "Ctrl+S" on Windows or "Cmd+S" on Mac).

Once you've saved your commit message, close the editor window to return to the Git commit interface in VS Code. You should see your full commit message displayed in the input field.

## USER
Is there a way to do that in the terminal?

## ASSISTANT
Yes, you can also use the terminal to write longer commit messages by configuring Git to use a text editor. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the Git repository you're working on.
2. Run the following command to set your preferred text editor for Git:

   ```bash
   git config --global core.editor "nano"
   ```

   Note: Replace "nano" with your preferred text editor (e.g., "vim", "emacs", "sublime", etc.).

3. To write a commit message, use the following command:

   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

   This will open your preferred text editor in the terminal, allowing you to write a longer commit message.

4. Write your commit message in the text editor and save the file.

5. Close the text editor to return to the terminal. Git will automatically use your saved commit message.

With this configuration, you can write longer, more detailed commit messages using your preferred text editor in the terminal.

## USER
When vs code opens VI to ask for my commit message, can I use longer commit messages there?

## ASSISTANT
Yes, when VS Code opens the VI editor to ask for your commit message, you can use longer commit messages in that editor.

By default, the VI editor has a single-line input field for entering text. However, you can use the "i" key to enter "Insert" mode and start typing your commit message. When you reach the end of the line, press the "Enter" key to start a new line and continue typing your message.

You can also use the arrow keys to navigate through your commit message, make changes, or delete text as needed. Once you've finished editing your commit message, press the "Esc" key to exit "Insert" mode and return to the command mode. Then type ":wq" (without quotes) and press the "Enter" key to save the changes and exit the editor.

In summary, yes, you can use longer commit messages when VS Code opens the VI editor to ask for your commit message, as long as you use the "Insert" mode to enter your message and the arrow keys to navigate and edit it.

## USER
In VS Code, how do I see my previous commit messages?

## ASSISTANT
To see your previous commit messages in VS Code, you can use the Git History panel. Here's how:

1. Open the VS Code sidebar by clicking on the Explorer icon on the left-hand side of the window.
2. At the top of the sidebar, click on the "Git" icon to open the Git panel.
3. In the Git panel, click on the "..." button at the top and select "Open in Git History" from the dropdown menu.
4. This will open the Git History panel, which shows a list of all the commits in your Git repository. Each commit is listed with its commit message, author, and timestamp.
5. To see more details about a particular commit, click on it to expand it. This will show you the commit's hash, parent commit(s), and the files that were changed in the commit.
6. To see the full commit message, hover your cursor over the commit message in the Git History panel. This will show you the entire commit message in a tooltip.

In addition to the Git History panel, you can also view your commit messages in the VS Code terminal by using the "git log" command. This command will show you a list of all the commits in your repository, along with their commit messages, authors, and timestamps. To use this command, open the VS Code terminal by clicking on "View" > "Terminal" in the menu bar, and then run the following command:

```bash
git log
```

This will show you a list of all the commits in your repository. To see the full commit message for a particular commit, find its hash in the list and then run the following command:

```bash
git show <commit-hash>
```

Replace "<commit-hash>" with the hash of the commit you want to see. This will show you the commit's full message, along with other details such as its author, timestamp, and the changes made in the commit.
