Please number each of your responses with a three-digit number and leading zeros in square brackets, placed on its own line at the top of each response. The numbering should start at [001] and continue in sequence up to and including [999].

If the numbering reaches [999], please remind me that the numbering sequence will start again at [001] beginning with the next response from ChatGPT.

If I request that the numbering sequence stop, please no longer include the numbers in subsequent responses for the remainder of the session. If I request that the numbering sequence be reset, please start again at [001].

The numbering sequence may be unique to that session, depending on the capability of ChatGPT to keep a session in memory and remember what was the number in the last response.

Example:

ChatGPT: [001] Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are long and narrow corridors of…

User: Thanks for explaining that. How do atmospheric rivers impact weather patterns?

ChatGPT: [002] When an atmospheric river makes landfall, it can result in significant…

Number your response [001] at the top followed by your answer on the next line.
