Hello, this is Bing. [Yes, hail does occur in Philippines](https://short-fact.com/does-hail-occur-in-philippines/)[<sup>1</sup>](https://short-fact.com/does-hail-occur-in-philippines/)[<sup>2</sup>](https://short-fact.com/does-hail-occur-in-philippines/)[<sup>3</sup>](https://heimduo.org/why-does-it-hail-in-the-philippines/), but it is not very common. [Hail usually occurs between May and July as the rainy season starts](https://short-fact.com/does-hail-occur-in-philippines/)[<sup>1</sup>](https://short-fact.com/does-hail-occur-in-philippines/)[<sup>2</sup>](https://short-fact.com/does-hail-occur-in-philippines/).

**Human:**

 I'd like to learn from a pulmonologist about heart stents and angiograms. Specifically, I'd like to know what to expect after having surgery to insert 2 stents. I'd like to know how much time for recovery. And I'd really like to see a blood pressure chart showing a normal blood pressure for a typical 27 year old woman as compared to a 27 year old woman who has the heart stents recently put in. Can you help me find those answers? especially help me find a chart to get a baseline for blood pressure for a 27 year old woman who is roughly 90 lbs.

Hello, this is Bing. Iâ€™m glad you want to learn more about your health. A pulmonologist is a doctor who specializes in lung diseases and conditions</a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://johnsonfrancis.org/professional/pulmonary-angiography/). A heart stent is a small tube that helps keep a blocked artery open</a>[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-angioplasty/about/pac-20384761). An angiogram is an X-ray test that shows your blood vessels</a>[<sup>3</sup>](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-angiogram/about/pac-20384904).


According to one source</a>[<sup>4</sup>](https://www.newhealthadvisor.org/Heart-Stent-Recovery-Time.html), most patients recover from a heart stent and angioplasty quickly. They can go back to work within a few days or a week. However, recovery time may vary depending on your condition and other factors.


Normal blood pressure for adults (ages 20 and older) is less than 120/80 mm Hg</a>[<sup>5</sup>](https://www.verywellhealth.com/average-blood-pressure-by-age-5085328). Hypertension is defined as having a systolic pressure of 130 mm Hg or higher, or a diastolic pressure of 80 mm Hg or higher</a>[<sup>5</sup>](https://www.verywellhealth.com/average-blood-pressure-by-age-5085328). Here is a table that shows blood pressure ranges by age group:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Age group</th>
<th>Systolic (mm Hg)</th>
<th>Diastolic (mm Hg)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>18-24</td>
<td>105-120</td>
<td>62-80</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>25-29</td>
<td>108-121</td>
<td>64-81</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>30-34</td>
<td>110-123</td>
<td>66-83</td>
</tr>

I could not find any specific chart for blood pressure for a 27 year old woman who weighs roughly 90 lbs. However, you can use this online calculator to estimate your ideal blood pressure based on your age, gender, height and weight.


I hope this information helps you. Do you have any other questions? ðŸ˜Š

**Human:**

 If you're able to search scholarly articles, please search for any articles summarizing women from age 20-29 who have had angioplasty and what their blood pressure was after the surgery.

Iâ€™m sorry but I could not find any articles that specifically summarize women from age 20-29 who have had angioplasty and what their blood pressure was after the surgery. However, I found some articles that may be related to your topic:



- 

Blood pressure outcome of angioplasty in atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis: a randomized trial[<sup>1</sup>](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9495267/). This study compared blood pressure changes between patients who received drug treatment or angioplasty for renal artery stenosis. It found that angioplasty lowered blood pressure more than drug treatment after 6 months.



- 

Angioplasty Article - StatPearls[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/viewarticle/17579/). This article provides an overview of angioplasty, its indications, contraindications, complications and outcomes. It also discusses some specific types of angioplasty such as bioresorbable scaffolds (BRS).



- 

Angioplasty of Flow-Limiting Stenosis Reduces Aortic and Brachial Blood Pressure in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease[<sup>3</sup>](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34227407/). This study measured blood pressure changes before and after angioplasty in patients with peripheral artery disease. It found that angioplasty reduced both aortic and brachial blood pressure significantly.

[Women and Hypertension: Beyond the 2017 Guideline for Prevention â€¦](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2018/07/27/09/02/women-and-hypertension)[<sup>5</sup>](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2018/07/27/09/02/women-and-hypertension). This article summarizes the 2017 guideline for prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults. It also discusses some special considerations for women such as preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and postmenopausal hypertension.






I hope these articles are helpful for you. Do you want me to summarize any of them for you? ðŸ˜Š
