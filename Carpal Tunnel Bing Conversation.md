**Human:**

 do studies show that using a mouse causes more reppetitive strain injury than a keyboard?

***

**Assistant:**

According to experts, including the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, little clinical evidence suggests computer keyboard use is a risk factor for developing Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS). Although other types of hand strain can result from overuse of a keyboard or mouse, CTS likely is not linked to these actions</a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/6383-workplace-myth). However, using a mouse regularly involves stationary positions and small and repetitive movements of the same small muscles over and over again for prolonged periods of time</a>[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/office/mouse/mouse_problems.html).


Would you like me to look up more information on this topic?

**Human:**

 Yes. Let's find some peer-reviewed studies on the cause of CTS. Show me a numbered list of no less than 5 sources, each with an APA style citation and a summary. Provide an APA style bibliography at the end of your numbered list.

**Assistant:**
I found several peer-reviewed studies on Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) that discuss its symptoms, causes and treatment options. Here are five sources with APA style citations and summaries:
