# Feedback for ConnorDickson.net Portfolio

Under skills don't skip including "Excel" and any other associated skills such as Power Query and VBA. I've heard manager say, "Well they didn't say they know Excel so I guess they never learned it." or something like that.

Great color choices especially because the shirt kind of matches the theme.

The heading for the portfolio should be "Professional Portfolio" rather than "My Personal Portfolio" as the latter gives the impression that it is perhaps just a hobby rather than something you do as a career.

In the About Me section include education. If you don't have a bachelor's degree then leave it blank as you have it now, but if you have that, leaving it blank indicates to recruiters that you don't have a degree and some companies use that as a screening device. Also Add hobbies and or a general statement about your personality. The About me section is traditionally intended to show how you are a personality match for the company.

Instead of a button that opens an email to contact you, add a contact form. I think you are using Google sites, so I think you can simply embed a "Google Form" in the HTML so that it sends you a notification or email. The reason this is important is because many scammers scrape personal websites for emails and sell them to mailing lists. It is also a more professional way to let the user send you a message rather than prompting an email application to open on their computer (depending on their operating system).

You have a sticky toolbar at the top which also serves as the landing page header, you should add a landing page footer as well that has a copywrite notice and that is where you want to put your links to social media. A good footer has the copywrite notice, the privacy notice and a link to a separate About Me page. But it doesn't hurt to have the about me on the landing page. I'd also simply remove the "me@connordicson" in the footer. It's both redundant and a bad practice to put your text email address in the footer. Simply put something like "copyright (c) 2023 connordickson.net" in the footer along the far left and your social media links in the far right.

You should add a "Blog" section to the site and a link in the toolbar, let Google index your blog so that it shows up in search results. You have a search icon and it works out of the box from Google sites, but the results are a little sparse.

Ie you know how, you should add a "dark" theme button, a lot of people really hate bright white backgrounds because it's so common for those of us who work on computers to have an astigmatism. Having a dark theme button will show you are also a little bit more cabable of learning new skills like web design on the fly. My experience is employers love evidence that shows you can learn new things quickly. Worst case scenario use ChatGPT to ask it to give you a snippet that could change the theme of your site to dark them and ask it how to link it to a button.


## GitHub Page Feedback

I'd say it's a good start and just a few words of advice

### For All Projects

You should always show that you used a "dev" branch in your portfolio projects. This shows a good understanding of how git works. If you only have a "main" branch and no comments in any of the commits then it indicates that you might not be very proficient in using git. You might be great though. I do the same thing, I commit with really generic msgs sometimes and on a lot of my projects I just commit to the main branch because I'm by nature a little lazy. But for a portfolio, you might want to use a project where you covered all the minute details that a senior would look for. Especially if you are going to be a senior, then your job will be teaching those skills to new people and nothing is worse than somone committing to the main branch and screwing things up.

I used ChatGPT and some of my own ideas to generate the following README template for data projects.
