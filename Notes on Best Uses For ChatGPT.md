# Notes on Best Uses For ChatGPT

A great course on ChatGPT is linked below and gives a very in-depth explanation of "prompt engineering."

[ChatGPT 101 Supercharge Your Work &amp; Life (500+ Prompts inc)  Udemy](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/course/chatgpt-101-supercharge-your-work-life-500-prompts-inc/)

A high-quality prompt leads to a higher quality output because it provides the chatbot with necessary information and context. Poorly written prompts may result in less accurate or relevant responses. It is important to craft high-quality prompts to get accurate and helpful responses from ChatGPT.

## Prompt Structure

Below is a detailed set of templates that can be copy and pasted (with the relevant fields filled in) to generate high quality outputs from ChatGPT. Although the level of detail for the prompt may vary, the more information included, the more effective the output will be.

### Basic Prompts

#### Template _without_ context/primer

Use this template when there is no need to include any context or primer information with the prompt.

```json
   {
      "Expert persona of": {
         "prefix": "persona of ",
         "body": [
            "Take on the persona of ${1:expert persona}.",
            "${2:verb action}.",
            "${3:optional length and output format}.",
            "${4:tone of voice}.",
            "${5:target audience}."
         ],
         "description": "Define the expert persona to use"
      }
   }
```
