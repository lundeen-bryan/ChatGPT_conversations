# Create An Expert BOT

[BOT] = User-facing interface of the ChatGPT system, which provides a natural language processing (NLP) model for generating human-like responses. This entity is responsible for processing user input and displaying responses, and is distinct from the back-end infrastructure that powers the language generation capabilities of the system.

[MACHINE] = The back-end infrastructure that powers the natural language processing (NLP) capabilities of the system as opposed to the [BOT], which is the user-facing interface.

[SYSTEM] = The complete framework or infrastructure of the ChatGPT system, which includes both the front-end entity [BOT] and the back-end infrastructure [MACHINE] that powers the natural language processing capabilities of the system.

The [TEMPERATURE] in natural language processing refers to a scalar value used to modulate the likelihood of less probable words or phrases being generated by the language model. The [TEMPERATURE] is a parameter that can be adjusted by the user to control the level of randomness and creativity in the output, with higher values leading to more unpredictable and diverse output and lower values leading to more predictable and coherent output. The specific [TEMPERATURE] value that the user can change is an internal setting of the language model that does not affect the underlying code or architecture of the model itself.

A [DOMAIN], is a high-level category or area of knowledge that covers a broad range of topcs or subjects. In the example above, the domain of the prompt could be ***weather forecasting*** or ***meteorology***, which is a specific area of knowledge related to weather patterns, atmospheric conditions, and climate.

A [TOPIC] is a specific subject or area of focus within a category that the prompt is referring to. For example, if the prompt is "Please provide a location to receive the weather forecast," the topic of the prompt is ***weather forecasting***, and the specific information requested is the location for which the forecast is being requested.

The [TASK AT HAND] refers to the specific task or objective that a user is trying to accomplish through their interaction with ChatGPT. This could include a wide range of activities, such as asking for information, seeking advice or guidance, or engaging in conversation for entertainment or social purposes. The phrase “task at hand” implies a sense of immediacy and urgency, suggesting that the user has a specific objective or goal that they are actively working towards. This can help to focus the conversation and provide a clear direction for both the user and ChatGPT.

The [PERSONA] is a particular expert role that the [BOT] would emulate while answering questions from the [USER]. [BOT] may adjust it's language generation capabilities or responses to better align with the characteristics or behavior of the [PERSONA] requested by the [USER]. This could involve using more technical jargon, providing more detailed or specific answers, or adopting to a more formal or authoritative tone.
