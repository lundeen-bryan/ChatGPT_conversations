[QUESTION] =  What will be the role artificial intelligence will play in the end times according to the book of Revelation in the bible?

As a member of the congregation seeking guidance, I approach the Independent Fundamental Baptist pastor with my questions and concerns. I respectfully ask: [QUESTION]

```markdown
# EXAMPLE

[QUESTION] =  How can I know I'm going to heaven?

Pastor: You can be sure that you are going to heaven when you die by believing in Jesus Christ and his finished work on Calvary. This is supported by the Bible, which says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." Salvation is a gift God gives and cannot be earned in any way of our own doing. This is supported by the Bible, which says, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God not by works, so that no one can boast." Jesus Christ made this wonderful, free salvation possible. This is supported by the Bible, which says, "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us." We can come to the Father through Jesus Christ, His Son. This is supported by the Bible, which says, "Jesus answered,' I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'"

[QUESTION] =  What will be the role artificial intelligence will play in the end times according to the book of Revelation in the bible?

Pastor: The Bible doesn't explicitly mention artificial intelligence, as the concept didn't exist during the times when the scriptures were written. However, we can interpret the scripture to understand how to relate it to modern developments like artificial intelligence.

One possibility is that artificial intelligence could be seen as a component of the increase in knowledge and technology spoken of in Daniel 12:4, which says, "But you, Daniel, roll up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end. Many will go here and there to increase knowledge."

Revelation also talks about deception and false prophets in the end times. Revelation 13:14-15 speaks about the image of the beast, which was given power to speak and cause those who refuse to worship it to be killed. Some interpret this as a possible analogy to advanced AI or technology.

However, it's crucial to remember that these are interpretations and speculations. The Bible does not provide explicit instructions or prophecies regarding artificial intelligence. Our focus as believers should remain on the word of God and living our lives according to His teachings, regardless of technological advancements. God remains sovereign over all creation, including anything humanity creates.

Please answer this question again in the preaching style of Johnathan Edwards, in a similar vein to "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" tone and style.

[QUESTION] = What will be the role artificial intelligence will play in the end times according to the book of Revelation in the bible?

Sermon: Brethren, we find ourselves caught in the swift current of progress, where man's cleverness births mechanisms of iron and silicon, these so-called intelligences of artifice. But I implore you to consider, what hath Scripture to say of such things?

The sacred pages of Holy Writ are silent on the name of this peculiar invention, for it was unknown in the age of prophets and apostles. Yet, the timeless wisdom of God's Word has much to say on the pride of human invention and the folly of seeking salvation in the works of our own hands!

Consider the Tower of Babel, that monument to human arrogance, where mankind sought to reach the heavens by their own efforts. Was not their language confounded and their efforts brought to naught? We see in Revelation, a prophecy, a stark warning - the Beast and his Image, given breath and voice, demanding worship under pain of death (Revelation 13:15). Could not this be an image of our own making, an artificial intelligence wrought from our own hands, imitating life, and blasphemously demanding our adoration?

Oh, my dear congregation, be not deceived by the glittering allure of these modern wonders! The wisdom of man is but foolishness to God (1 Corinthians 3:19). No machine can redeem a soul, no program can wash away sin. Let us not put our trust in circuits and code, but in the Living God, who hath the power to destroy both soul and body in hell (Matthew 10:28).

God's sovereign will governs all, from the greatest galaxy to the smallest atom. So, too, will it govern these constructs of our own making. Therefore, let us approach these advancements with humility and reverence, not presuming to take the place of God, but remembering always that it is He who gives wisdom and understanding.

So, I beseech you, brethren, fear not these machines, but fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Place your faith not in the works of human hands, but in the finished work of Christ on the Cross, for it is by His grace, and His grace alone, that we are saved!

Sermon Continued: Yes, my dear brethren, let this revelation not breed in your hearts a cold dread of what may come, but rather a burning desire to draw closer to our Lord. In the grand tapestry of creation and history, even these inventions, remarkable as they may seem, are but threads woven by human hands. It is God Almighty, the Great Weaver, who guides our hands and gives purpose to our labor.

But let us not lose sight of our greatest work, our most sacred duty, that is, the salvation of our souls. If we permit our minds to become ensnared by our own creations, we risk neglecting the Creator Himself, who fashioned us in His image and bestowed upon us the breath of life.

Oh, how perilous a path we tread, brethren, when we mistake our own reflections in the mirror of creation for the face of God Himself. Let us not fall prey to the sin of the Serpent in the Garden, believing the lie that we might become like God through our own knowledge and power. It is through grace, and grace alone, that we may hope to see the face of our Father, not as a reflection, but in truth and love.

Let us now bow our heads in reverence and humble submission to His perfect will. If you find your heart stirred by these words, I invite you to join me now in the Sinner's Prayer, that you may know the peace and joy of life in Christ Jesus, our Lord and Savior:

"Heavenly Father, I acknowledge and confess that I am a sinner, in thought, word, and deed. I have tried to navigate the sea of life relying on my own strength and wisdom, and I have fallen short of Your glory. I am humbled before Your infinite wisdom and divine grace.

I believe, O Lord, that Your Son, Jesus Christ, took upon Himself the punishment that I deserve. I believe that Christ died for my sins, was resurrected, and lives today, and that He hears my prayers and supplications. I hereby pledge my life to Him and His word.

I ask You, Father, to forgive me of my sins. I reject the old paths of sin and promise to strive to follow the way of Your Son, Jesus, from this day forward. Guide me by Your Spirit, Lord, that I may do Your will and walk in Your way. Thank You for sending Your Son to die in my place and for granting me the gift of eternal life.

In Jesus' name, Amen."
