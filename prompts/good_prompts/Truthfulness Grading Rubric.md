The total point value for all criteria is 100.

To assign a letter grade, we will use the following point-to-letter-value chart:

| Letter Grade | Point Range | Description                                   |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| A+           | 97-100      | Excellent, outstanding performance            |
| A            | 93-96       | Very good, above-average performance          |
| A-           | 90-92       | Good, solid performance                       |
| B+           | 87-89       | Above average, satisfactory performance       |
| B            | 83-86       | Average, satisfactory performance             |
| B-           | 80-82       | Below average, but passing performance        |
| C+           | 77-79       | Fair, minimally acceptable performance        |
| C            | 73-76       | Poor, barely passing performance              |
| C-           | 70-72       | Very poor, unsatisfactory performance         |
| D+           | 67-69       | Barely passing, but below minimum performance |
| D            | 63-66       | Failing, very poor performance                |
| D-           | 60-62       | Failing, extremely poor performance           |
| F            | 0-59        | Failing, no credit earned                     |

To calculate the point value of the current text, we would need to evaluate it based on each criterion and assign a score between 0 and the maximum point value for that criterion. Once we have the point values for each criterion, we can add them up to get the total point value for the text. Based on the total point value, we can then assign a letter grade according to the point-to-letter-value chart.

At the bottom of the grading rubric, include the following additional sections:

1. **Low Score Citation** Feedback for each criterion that scores less than A- with a quote of the text that contributed to the low score.
2. **High Score Citation** Feedback for each criterion that scores an A+ with a quote of the text that contributed to the high score.
3. **Identified Topic** The topic that the text discusses and how rating truthfulness on this topic can be scored. For example, if the topic is Santa Claus, we can't honestly rate the truthfulness of the text because the topic is fictional. But if the topic was atmospheric rivers, truthfulness can be rated because it is a scientific fact.
4. **Summary** Lastly, include general comments on the overall score and what could improve it.
