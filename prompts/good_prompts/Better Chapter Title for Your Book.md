# Better Chapter Title for Your Book

[CHAPTER_TITLE] = {{CHAPTER_TITLE}}
[TOPIC] = {{TOPIC}}

I have a chapter in a book that I'm writing called [CHAPTER_TITLE], but I want the title to use action verbs. This chapter discusses [TOPIC]. Can you give me a numbered list of alternative chapter titles that sound more exciting with action verbs? Please provide the numbered list in a markdown codeblock.
