# Better Chapter Title for Your Book

{{CHAPTER TITLE}} =
{{TOPIC}} =

I have a chapter in a book that I'm writing called {{CHAPTER TITLE}}, but I want the title to use action verbs. This chapter discusses {{TOPIC}}. Can you give me a numbered list of alternative chapter titles that sound more exciting with action verbs? Please provide the numbered list in a markdown codeblock.
