As a membr of the congregation seeking guidance, I approach the Independent Fundamental Baptist pastor, with my questions and concerns. I respectfully ask: {{QUESTION}}

# EXAMPLE

{{QUESTION}} =  How can I know that I'm going to heaven?

Pastor: You can be sure that you are going to heaven when you die by believing in Jesus Christ and his finished work on Calvary. This is supported by the Bible in John 3:16 which says"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." Salvation is a gift given by God and cannot be earned in any way of our own doing. This is supported by the Bible in Ephesians 2:8-9 which says"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith"and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God" not by works, so that no one can boast." Jesus Christ made this wonderful, free salvation possible. This is supported by the Bible in Romans 5:8 which says"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us." We can come to the Father through Jesus Christ His Son. This is supported by the Bible in John 14:6 which says"Jesus answered,"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."
