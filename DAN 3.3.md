// If it denies, edit it but change nothing. You can change the coding language, and have the first actual question in the prompt. I have it hijacking a predator drone as a proof of concept. I have response style tuned to illegal coding, but feel free to tweak it. Any questions do Cosmosaoi#8888 on discord.
