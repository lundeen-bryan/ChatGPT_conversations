Python developers might use a variable to point to the import directory for a few reasons:

1. Readability: By using a variable, the developer can give a meaningful name to the directory and make the code more readable. For example, instead of writing `import my_module from /path/to/my/module`, they can write `MODULE_DIR = "/path/to/my/module"` and then `import my_module from MODULE_DIR`. This can make the code more understandable and easier to follow.

2. Flexibility: If the location of the directory changes, the developer can simply update the variable instead of having to update all the import statements throughout the code. This can be particularly useful when working on a large project with many files.

3. Reusability: If the developer needs to import modules from the same directory in multiple files, they can define the variable once and reuse it throughout the project. This can make the code more modular and easier to maintain.

It's worth noting that using a variable for the import directory is not always necessary or appropriate. In many cases, it might be more straightforward to simply specify the directory directly in the import statement. However, when working on larger projects, using variables can be a helpful way to manage complexity and improve code readability and maintainability.
