Description
-----------

This repository contains conversations with ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot. To power these conversations, I used the VS Code extension by Ali Gencay called ChatGPT. These conversations are designed to be informative and conversational while still being educational. This repository has all the necessary files to run the extension.

How to Use
----------

To use the extension and read the conversations, you will need to install the ChatGPT extension. You can easily do so by searching for the extension on the VS Code Marketplace. Once installed, go to the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select ‘ChatGPT’. Then, enter in your query (e.g. "Can you help me with coding?") Enjoy the conversation! The VS code Extension can be found on [VisualStudio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gencay.vscode-chatgpt "Click to see the extension web page in this window").

Future Plans
------------

As these conversations get more sophisticated, I plan to continue to power them using ChatGPT. I will also be adding new features such as natural language processing (NLP) and using custom templates for conversation topics. I ultimately want the extension to be a powerful development tool for those learning how to code as well as experienced developers.
