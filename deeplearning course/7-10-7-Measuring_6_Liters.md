I have a 12 liter jug and a 6 liter jug. I want to measure 6 liters. How do I do that?

## ASSISTANT
To measure exactly 6 liters using a 12-liter jug and a 6-liter jug, follow these steps:

1. Fill the 6-liter jug completely.
2. Pour the water from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug.
3. Fill the 6-liter jug again.
4. Carefully pour the water from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug until the 12-liter jug is full.
5. Since the 12-liter jug can only hold 6 more liters when it already has 6 liters in it, you will be left with exactly 6 liters of water in the 6-liter jug.
