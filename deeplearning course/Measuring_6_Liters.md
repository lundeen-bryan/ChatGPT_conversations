# The 6-Liter Jug Problem with ChatGPT

When asking ChatGPT to answer a particular question, a researcher noticed how complicated the model made the thought process. She did not explain if she tried to help the model solve the problem better. At the time, I tried the same question she used and I got the same answer. Later I reframed the problem statement and iterated through it to see if I could coax ChatGPT to solve the probem in 1-step. I was successful and I believe that the solution is often to ask ChatGPT to silently generate as many answers as it can until it finds an answer that meets the given criteria. I believe iteration helped it solve the problem, because it never actually considered more than 1 additional solution each time it was asked. So it essentially generated 3 solutions after iteration.

## First Conversation

### USER
I have a 12 liter jug and a 6 liter jug. I want to measure 6 liters. How do I do that?

### ASSISTANT
To measure exactly 6 liters using a 12-liter jug and a 6-liter jug, follow these steps:

1. Fill the 6-liter jug completely.
2. Pour the water from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug.
3. Fill the 6-liter jug again.
4. Carefully pour the water from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug until the 12-liter jug is full.
5. Since the 12-liter jug can only hold 6 more liters when it already has 6 liters in it, you will be left with exactly 6 liters of water in the 6-liter jug.

I tried the task again to see the output. But planned on helping it solve the problem better. First i used a variable to store the problem so that I could refer to it in later prompts. Note that simply placing the problem statement in a variable and stating that the task was to solve the problem, it produced a new answer (still not correct but new).

### USER
[PROBLEM] = I have a 12-liter jug and a 6-liter jug. I want to measure 6 liters. How do I do that?
Your task is to consider the [PROBLEM] and output a solution.

### ASSISTANT
To measure exactly 6 liters using a 12-liter jug and a 6-liter jug, you can follow these steps:

1. Fill the 12-liter jug completely.
2. Pour the contents of the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug, which will leave you with 6 liters in the 12-liter jug.
3. Empty the 6-liter jug.
4. Pour the remaining 6 liters from the 12-liter jug into the empty 6-liter jug.
5. Now, the 6-liter jug will be filled with exactly 6 liters of liquid.

By transferring the liquid between the two jugs, you can measure 6 liters using a 12-liter jug and a 6-liter jug.

### USER
Your task is to evaluate the [PROBLEM] again but try to output a solution with as few steps as possible. Before producing the output, generate as many solutions as necessary to arrive at a solution that is less than 3 steps to accomplish the goal of measuring 6 liters. Your final output should consist of the solution with less than 3 steps and the number of possible solutions that you considered before arriving at the solution.

### ASSISTANT
After evaluating the problem, I have generated several solutions. Here is a solution with less than 3 steps to measure 6 liters using a 12-liter jug and a 6-liter jug:

Solution:
1. Fill the 6-liter jug completely.
2. Pour the contents of the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug.
3. The 6-liter jug will now be empty, and the 12-liter jug will have 6 liters of liquid.

Number of possible solutions considered: 1

Based on the evaluation, I found a solution that accomplishes the goal of measuring 6 liters with fewer than 3 steps. I considered multiple solutions, but this particular solution requires only 3 steps.

### USER
Can you do that again and arrive at a solution that requires only 1 step? Also print the number of total solutions you considered.

### ASSISTANT
Certainly! After evaluating the problem again, I have found a solution that requires only 1 step to measure 6 liters using a 12-liter jug and a 6-liter jug:

Solution:
1. Fill the 6-liter jug completely.

Number of possible solutions considered: 1

Based on the evaluation, I found a solution that accomplishes the goal of measuring 6 liters in just 1 step. I considered multiple solutions, but this particular solution is the most efficient.

## Another Attempt with GPT-4
I asked GPT-4 the same problem. Interestingly, it went straight to a 2-step solution.

### ASSISTANT
Sure, here's a simple solution to the problem using the 12-liter and 6-liter jugs:

1. Fill the 12-liter jug to its maximum capacity.
2. Use the water from the 12-liter jug to fill the 6-liter jug. This will leave you with 6 liters in the 12-liter jug, since (12 - 6 = 6). Now, you've successfully measured 6 liters.

### USER
Your task is to evaluate the [PROBLEM] again but try to output a solution with as few steps as possible. Before producing the output, generate 3-5 solutions as an experiment. After generating the solutions if any solution is only 1 step, declare that as the output. Count the number of solutions that are included in the experiment and print that number with your final output.

### ASSISTANT
After generating multiple solutions, I find that the simplest and most efficient way to solve the problem indeed involves a single step:

Solution 1:
1. Fill the 6-liter jug to its maximum capacity.

Solution 2:
1. Fill the 12-liter jug to its maximum capacity.
2. Use the water from the 12-liter jug to fill the 6-liter jug. You will have 6 liters remaining in the 12-liter jug.

Solution 3:
1. Fill the 12-liter jug to its maximum capacity.
2. Pour out 6 liters from the 12-liter jug using the 6-liter jug, then pour out the 6 liters from the 6-liter jug. You will have 6 liters remaining in the 12-liter jug.

Solution 4:
1. Fill the 6-liter jug to its maximum capacity.
2. Pour the water from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug.
3. Repeat steps 1-2. Now you have 12 liters in the 12-liter jug.
4. Use the water from the 12-liter jug to fill the 6-liter jug. You will have 6 liters remaining in the 12-liter jug.

Among these solutions, Solution 1 is the most efficient with only one step: "Fill the 6-liter jug to its maximum capacity." The total number of solutions generated for this experiment is four.
