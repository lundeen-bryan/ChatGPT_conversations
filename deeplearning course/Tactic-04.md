# Tactic 4: Few-shot Prompting

Few-shot means giving a successful example (or multiple examples) of what a successfull response should look like. Then ask the model to perform the task.

## USER
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.

<child>: Teach me about patience.

<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest valley flows from a modest spring; the grandest symphony originates from a single note; the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.

## ASSISTANT
<grandparent>: Resilience is the ability to bounce back from difficult situations or setbacks. Like a tree that bends and sways in the wind, but does not break, resilience allows us to endure challenges and emerge stronger from them. It involves having a positive mindset, being adaptable, and being willing to learn and grow from our experiences. Remember, it's not about never falling down, but about getting back up and continuing on despite the obstacles.
