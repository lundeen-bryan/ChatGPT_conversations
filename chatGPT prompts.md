Now I will place some code below. I want you to use the template I provided in the previous response to complete a docstring for the code. Your response will be wrapped in a Markdown codeblock. No line should be more than 96 characters, so wrap any lines beyond 96 characters. Before you respond, let me know you understand with "..." as your response. When I see that you respond with "..." I will send you my VBA code.
