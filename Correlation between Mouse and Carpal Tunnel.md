## **The Correlation between Computer Mouse Use and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common condition affecting the hand and wrist. It is caused by the compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. Computer use, especially the use of a mouse, has been suggested as a potential risk factor for developing CTS. This essay will provide an overview of the correlation between computer mouse use and carpal tunnel syndrome.

### **Overview of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a painful condition that affects the hand and wrist. The median nerve, which runs from the forearm to the hand, passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passage formed by the wrist bones and a ligament. When the median nerve is compressed or pinched in the carpal tunnel, it can cause pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and wrist ([^1]National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NINDS], 2021[^5]).

CTS can be caused by a variety of factors, including repetitive hand movements, wrist injuries, medical conditions such as diabetes and arthritis, and hormonal changes during pregnancy or menopause (NINDS, 2021[^5]).

### **Overview of Computer Mouse Use**

Computer mouse use is a common activity in modern life. A mouse is used to move the cursor on the computer screen, select items, and perform other functions. It requires the user to grip the mouse and move it around on a surface, which can involve repetitive hand and wrist movements.

### **The Correlation between Computer Mouse Use and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**

Research has suggested that computer mouse use may be a risk factor for developing carpal tunnel syndrome. The repetitive hand and wrist movements involved in using a mouse can cause strain on the wrist and compress the median nerve, leading to CTS (Armstrong et al., 2008)[^1].

A study by Bao et al. (2015)[^2] found that computer mouse use was associated with an increased risk of carpal tunnel syndrome in office workers. The study included 633 office workers, of which 41.3% used a mouse for more than 20 hours per week. The study found that those who used a mouse for more than 20 hours per week had a significantly higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome compared to those who used a mouse for less than 10 hours per week.

Another study by Gerr et al. (2002)[^3] found that computer mouse use was a significant predictor of carpal tunnel syndrome in a group of 1202 workers. The study found that those who used a mouse for more than 20 hours per week had a higher risk of developing CTS compared to those who used a mouse for less than 10 hours per week.

A third study by Palmer et al. (2018)[^6] found that computer mouse use was associated with an increased risk of carpal tunnel syndrome in both office and non-office workers. The study included 4208 participants, of which 58.2% used a mouse for more than 5 hours per day. The study found that those who used a mouse for more than 5 hours per day had a significantly higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome compared to those who used a mouse for less than 2 hours per day.

### **Prevention and Treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**

Preventing carpal tunnel syndrome can involve taking breaks during repetitive activities, using ergonomic equipment such as a mouse pad with wrist support, and practicing good posture (Mayo Clinic, 2021)[^4]. Treatment options for carpal tunnel syndrome include wrist splints, medication, physical therapy, and surgery in severe cases (NINDS, 2021)[^5].

### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, computer mouse use has been identified as a potential risk factor for developing carpal tunnel syndrome. Studies have shown that prolonged use of a mouse can increase the risk of CTS, especially in office workers who use a mouse for more than 20 hours per week. Additionally, research has found that computer mouse use is associated with an increased risk of carpal tunnel syndrome in both office and non-office workers who use a mouse for more than 5 hours per day. Preventing and treating carpal tunnel syndrome can involve taking breaks during repetitive activities, using ergonomic equipment, and practicing good posture.
